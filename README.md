# Pixy2-robot-dog-chase-drv8835
This is a simple implementation of the chase mode with pixy2 along with DRV8835. The code I used is the same given CMS for Pixy called as ccc_zumo_chase. You can see it under examples -> Pixy2 -> ccc_zumo_chase

I have also put a copy incase you wish to see the code in browser. The motor driver I used is the DVR8835.
